	o This can be done by modifying the existing applications (e.g., App1, App2, App3, App4, App5, FlyingMouse, SensorTag App, etc.). 

	o The text file should include at least FOUR types of information on your activities (e.g., Time, GPS, Acceleration, Temperature, Humidity, Signal Strength, Gyroscope, Pressure, etc.). 

	o The text file should include at least FOUR types of information on your activities (e.g., Time, GPS, Acceleration, Temperature, Humidity, Signal Frequency, Gyroscope, Pressure, etc.). Refer to SensorTag-UUID if you want to implement an application using SensorTag.

 Implement an HBase client application to insert your data to HBase (either Local Cloudera or UMKC Cloudera servers). Try to improve the original data model shown in Tutorial 2.

 Show your lab work to either the instructor or TA during the lab session.
